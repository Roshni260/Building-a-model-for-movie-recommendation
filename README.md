# Building-a-model-for-movie-recommendation

## Hello FriendsðŸ˜Š 
### I have made a Machine Learning model to recommend movies based on individual's choice

I have build a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) model

K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.It assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories. It stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
